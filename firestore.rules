/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides basic protection for data stored in Firestore, focusing on preventing unauthorized data access and modification. Since there is no user authentication, the rulesets ensure that all the data stored can be read by anyone and created, updated, or deleted by anyone. However, this setup is intended for the prototyping phase only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of three top-level collections:
 * - /subscribers/{subscriberId}: Stores data from the subscriber landing page.
 * - /freelancers/{freelancerId}: Stores data from the freelancer landing page.
 * - /brand_collaborations/{brandCollaborationId}: Stores data from the brand collaboration landing page.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No authentication is required for read or write access in the initial prototype.
 * - All read and write access is open to all users, including unauthenticated users.
